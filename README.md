The Dynamic Lighting brings an old school lighting technique to Unity.

Primarily tested to work with [RealtimeCSG](https://github.com/LogicalError/realtime-CSG-for-unity).

## Reflection Probes

When you bake reflection probes, Unity may also create a small lightmap that messes up the UV1 coordinates when you enter play mode. You can fix this by disabling the baked global illumination in the lighting settings:
